# SCI Open Ontology

The SCI Open Ontology project aims to provide a unified representation of SCI and its application.

## Scope

The main aim of this project is to help practitioners define the software boundary of the SCI application in a unified way. The first milestone would be to create the base ontology and constructs for an SCI application.

## Definitions
- SCI Open Ontology will provide a common terminology to define the software boundary
of the SCI applicationÂ 
- SCI Open Ontology provides base constructs for SCI application, which can be extended based
on application requirements
- Based on the software boundary, the SCI Score would be calculated. SCI Open Ontology will leverage CarbonQL API in future.(current code base uses approximate values for calculations)
- In a future iteration, using this SCI model, you can compare two models and what caused changes in SCI scores across releases.
