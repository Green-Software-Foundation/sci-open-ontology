# SCI Open Ontology

The SCI Open Ontology project aims to provide a unified representation of SCI and its application.

# Scope

The main aim of this project is to help practitioners define the software boundary of the SCI application in a unified way. The first milestone provides a prototype of the base ontology and constructs for an SCI application. Using the base ontology, you can define the software boundary and calculate the SCI score. This library is developed in Python and uses graphvix internally for creating an open ontology diagram.

# Dependency
- Install all packages mentioned in the requirement file
- Install graphvix from https://graphviz.org/download/
- The test.py file contains an example that can be used to test the library
